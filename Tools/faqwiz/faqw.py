"""FAQ wizard bootstrap."""

# This is a longer version of the bootstrap script given at the end of
# faqwin.py; it prints timing statistics at the end of the regular CGI
# script's output (so you can monitor how it is doing).

# This script should be placed in your cgi-bin directory and made
# executable.

# You need to edit the first line and the lines that define FAQDIR and
# SRCDIR, below: change /usr/local/bin/python to where your Python
# interpreter lives, change the value for FAQDIR to where your FAQ
# lives, and change the value for SRCDIR to where your faqwiz.py
# module lives.  The faqconf.py and faqcust.py files live there, too.

import os
t1 = os.times() # If this doesn't work, just get rid of the timing code!

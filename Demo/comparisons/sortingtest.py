# 2)  Sorting Test
#
#     Sort an input file that consists of lines like this
#
#         var1=23 other=14 ditto=23 fred=2
#
#     such that each output line is sorted WRT to the number.  Order
#     of output lines does not change.  Resolve collisions using the
#     variable name.   e.g.
#
#         fred=2 other=14 ditto=23 var1=23
#
#     Lines may be up to several kilobytes in length and contain
#     zillions of variables.

# This implementation:
# - Reads stdin, writes stdout
# - Uses any amount of whitespace to separate fields
# - Allows signed numbers
# - Treats illegally formatted fields as field=0
# - Outputs the sorted fields with exactly one space between them
# - Handles blank input lines correctly

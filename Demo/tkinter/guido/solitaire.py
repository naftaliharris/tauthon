"""Solitaire game, much like the one that comes with MS Windows.

Limitations:

- No cute graphical images for the playing cards faces or backs.
- No scoring or timer.
- No undo.
- No option to turn 3 cards at a time.
- No keyboard shortcuts.
- Less fancy animation when you win.
- The determination of which stack you drag to is more relaxed.

Apology:

I'm not much of a card player, so my terminology in these comments may
at times be a little unusual.  If you have suggestions, please let me
know!

In classes deriving from :class:`BaseHTTPServer`, including
:class:`SimpleHTTPServer` and :class:`CGIHttpServer`, make sure that the
requested URL's path doesn't start with a double slash which, if copied in
the Location header on redirection, would be interpreted as redirection to
another host ("//host/path" URL).

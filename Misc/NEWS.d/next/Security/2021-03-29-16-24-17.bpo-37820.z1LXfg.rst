Disallow URLs starting with URL:, and those wrapped between a pair of
('<','>') characters, so that local files cannot be accessed by passing in
something like 'URL:/etc/passwd' or '</etc/passwd>'.

There is really no justification to keep these old quirks from the very root of
Python, they are not documented and pose a security risk for those wanting to
selectively rule out schemes allowing to access local files.
